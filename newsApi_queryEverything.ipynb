Electric vehicles are the future. The companies that bring us that future will be the leaders of tomorrow... and will make early investors rich beyond their wildest dreams.</p> <h3><strong>Analysis Paralysis</strong></h3> <p>So which EV company should you invest in? Obviously, Tesla is at the top of the heap. It&rsquo;s the market leader. Heck, it established the whole market in the first place with its Roadster.</p> <p>But is it going to keep delivering the kinds of stock gains it has in the past? <a href=\"https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/battery-day-a-make-or-break-moment-for-tesla/97017\">Tesla stock</a> went public at $17 a share. Adjusted for the recent split, that&rsquo;s $3.40 a share. Those investors have made a 15,000% gain.</p> <p>The stock might go up that much more again, but as a company gets bigger and bigger, those gains become tougher and tougher to make.</p> <p>What about the newly public Chinese entrants like Kandi and NIO? Should you buy their stocks? Personally, I&rsquo;m not a fan of Chinese companies. They can say whatever they want about their autonomy; they operate under an authoritarian government. They&rsquo;re Chinese government companies.</p> <p>And they&rsquo;re wide open for fraud since they don&rsquo;t have to follow the same regulatory rules as U.S.-domiciled companies.</p> <p>So what does that leave? Nikola? Scandalous. Workhorse? Potential. GM or Ford? In the famous words of Joe Biden, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, man.&rdquo;</p> <p>With so many choices out there, it can be tough to make a decision at all. That&rsquo;s sometimes called &ldquo;analysis paralysis.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s when you get stuck on the research and aren&rsquo;t able to make a move.</p> <p>But I&rsquo;m here to help. I&rsquo;ve been watching and investing in this market since it was just one company, and I have the inside track on a company that could become the next Tesla that I want to share with you.</p> <p>But if I don&rsquo;t think you should invest in any of these publicly traded <a href=\"https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/forget-tesla-nasdaq-tsla-here-s-a-better-strategy-for-ev-investors/97309\">EV companies</a>, yet I do think you should be invested in the EV market, where on earth do I want you to put your hard-earned money to watch it grow?</p> <h3><strong>The Most Exclusive Club on Earth</strong></h3> <p>For nearly a century, the most lucrative investment market in the world has been off-limits to 99% of the investing world. Legally, the vast majority of us could not invest in this market even if we knew it existed.</p> <p>For most of the world, the existence of such a profitable market was a complete mystery, and it was kept that way for decades for a reason.</p> <p>You see, the rules of finance are written by politicians, and politicians are bought and paid for by wealthy people. Wealthy people like to keep their money &ldquo;in the family.&rdquo;</p> <p>They don&rsquo;t want a whole lot of &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; like us getting the chance to join their club. They&rsquo;ll spend as much money as they have to, bribing politicians to keep their interests protected.</p> <p>So it shouldn&rsquo;t be that surprising that they were able to get their employees in congress to make it illegal for anyone but them, the uber-wealthy, to invest in the most profitable companies.</p> <p>To paraphrase George Carlin, it was one big club and you weren&rsquo;t in it.</p> <p>But that&rsquo;s all changed recently. In a complete about-face, Congress passed a law that favors the average investor. It finally opened the most profitable corner of the market to everyone.</p> <p>How profitable am I talking here? Well, according to recent studies, this market returns 55% per year on average &mdash; in good times and in bad ones.</p> <p>Compare that to the public markets that barely average 10% gains (and that&rsquo;s before inflation), and you see why it&rsquo;s imperative you get invested too.</p> <p>Or, even better, compare Tesla&rsquo;s early investors to its IPO investors.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/an-airbnb-ipo-is-coming/97732\">IPO investors</a>, as you already know, are looking at a 15,000% gain &mdash; pretty darned good.</p> <p>But Tesla&rsquo;s earliest investors got in at $0.50 a share. After adjusting for the recent stock split, that&rsquo;s $0.10 a share. At current prices, they have a <strong>535,000% gain</strong>.</p> <p>In fact, this market has been shown to capture nearly all of the profits seen by investors in companies. About 30 years ago, it was practically the opposite. Most of the profits were made by investing in public stocks.</p> <p>Today, more than <strong>90%</strong>&nbsp;of investor profits are earned&nbsp;<em><u>outside</u></em>&nbsp;of the traditional stock market!</p> <p>And while everyone is now eligible to invest in this lucrative market, still less than a quarter of a percent of the population even knows it exists.</p> <p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping to change.</p> <h3><strong>Taking <em>Main Street </em>to Wall Street</strong></h3> <p>You see, I&rsquo;m talking about <a href=\"https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/how-to-invest-in-private-companies/96863\">the private market</a> here. I&rsquo;ve been investing in this market for years, even before Congress made the change.</p> <p>I was fortunate &mdash; I worked for a big investment bank. I made connections (and lots of money). I became eligible for this market. And I spent years studying successful investors&rsquo; strategies.</p> <p>So I have more than a little experience investing in companies outside of the stock market.</p> <p>And because I&rsquo;ve participated in the market, I know how life-changing the profits can be. I&rsquo;m talking about the ability to fund a retirement, pay off a house, or pay for college with just one investment.</p> <p>I mean really life-changing money &mdash; money you can use to plan the rest of your life, live in luxury for the rest of your years and still have plenty left over to leave to your family or favorite charity.</p> <p>So I want to help as many people as I can get a piece of the profits in this lucrative market. I want as many people as possible to get a chance to walk away with those storybook gains of 100,000%, and I want to make sure you only consider the best investments in this market.</p> <p>After decades of building a network of entrepreneurs and venture investors and after refining my strategy through my own investments, I founded a first of its kind investment advisory service called <a href=\"https://www.angelpub.com/premium-detailed/msv\"><em>Main Street Ventures</em>.</a></p> <p>Our goal is to open these lucrative markets to all and to&nbsp;serve as your&nbsp;guide through the often-complex world of private investments.</p> <p>Since launching this year, we&rsquo;ve helped to fund five companies. One of them went public a week or so ago. We got in late on that company but still made a quick double on our investment.</p> <p>As I type, we have two open <a href=\"https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/our-company-just-went-public-/97694\">investments in private companies</a> that have all the promise to become stock market stars after an IPO in a year or two.</p> <p>And we have the chance to invest in them long before they hit the open markets.</p> <p>One of them is the EV company I think you should be putting your money to work with.</p> <h3><strong>The Real Tesla of Trucks</strong></h3> <p>Before its scandalous fall from grace, Nikola was styled as the &ldquo;Tesla of Trucks.&rdquo; It turns out the company didn&rsquo;t actually have a working truck though.</p> <p>But I found the real &ldquo;Tesla of Trucks.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a private company you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of.</p> <p>And I also found a way for you to <a href=\"https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/how-to-invest-in-companies-before-they-go-public/97577\">invest in it BEFORE it hits the public markets</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>This company is right about where Tesla was back when early investors scooped up shares for less than $0.50. Actually, it&rsquo;s a lot further along than Tesla was back then.</p> <p>Elon Musk himself admitted that at Tesla&rsquo;s earliest funding round the company was nothing but, &ldquo;three partners with an unfunded business plan and no trademarks, assets, or offices to their name.&rdquo;</p> <p><div class=\"panel signup-primary\"> <div class=\"panel-heading font-20px\">Investing in Fuel Cells?</div> <div class=\"panel-body white background\"> <p>We have you covered!
